EXPRESS JS
    - with node js you have to write of crunchy codes
    - what is express.js?
    - Middle ware
    - requsts and responses 
    - Routing 
    - api route hand
    - btw how do you write backend in next.js, it is a full stack frame work which sytax do we use for doin that
    - reuturning html file pages


frame work - express.js
    - express.js without having the express.js
    - express.js is not just used during production it is to be used during the production deployment also so we have to install it on the system as well 


MIDDLE WARE

the incomming request is automatically funneled through a buch of functions
muliple function
    - request is funneled thorugh these then send res
    - you travel from middleware to middle ware using next

HANDLING INCOMMING REQUESTS

    - EXPRESS.JS is all about MIDDLE WARE
    - REQUEST -> MIDDLEWARE -> MIDDLE WARE -> RESPONSE


APP.USE 
    - every use of the app.use creates a new middle ware 
    - i.e the function that will be called whenver that path is reached 
    - anothe thing for the paht it does not have to be the absolute path
        - if the thing starts with the '/' -- then any time any path that will be started with the '/' -- this code will be executed 
        - so it just need to start with that thing for it to be executed
